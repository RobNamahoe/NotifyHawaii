{"name":"Notify Hawai'i","tagline":"","body":"Overview\r\n--------\r\nNotify Hawai'i is a web based application with a single goal: to deliver useful information to its users in the form of customized notifications. \r\n\r\n![alt tag](https://github.com/RobNamahoe/NotifyHawaii/blob/master/doc/images/home.png)\r\n\r\nApproach\r\n--------\r\nRegistered users will be able to select from a set of services related to local sources of information (i.e. within Hawai'i). Each service will allow for notifications to be sent to the user via email or text message when specific events are triggered (such as a new blog entry in a local forum or a specific bus running ahead of/behind schedule). The triggering events will be monitored through the use of a variety of services including Google Maps, TheBus Web Services API, and Jaunt Web Scraping and Automation tool.\r\n\r\nServices\r\n--------\r\nThere is currently only one service implemented in the system: News Services. This service aggregates headlines from several news sources around the web (selected by the user) and delivers the content by email or text message at the time specified by the user.\r\n\r\n![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RobNamahoe/NotifyHawaii/master/mockup/readme/news.png)\r\n\r\nWe will soon be adding new services to the application including commute and blog related options.\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\nView the [User Guide](https://github.com/RobNamahoe/NotifyHawaii/wiki/User-Guide).<br>\r\nView the [Developers Guide](https://github.com/RobNamahoe/NotifyHawaii/wiki/Developer-Guide).\r\n\r\nAccess the Application\r\n----------------------\r\nView the [deployed application](http://www.notifyhawaii.com/) on Heroku.<br>\r\nView this projects [GitHub Page](http://robnamahoe.github.io/NotifyHawaii/)\r\n\r\nIf you've got any questions, comments or suggestions for improvements, we'd love to hear from you!
